## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) 

### System overview


### RAG flow answering



### Evaluate 

The evaluation metrics currently in use are:

- **Recall@k**: Evaluate the accuracy of information retrieval
- **Correctness**:The metric evaluates the answer generated by the system to match a given query reference answer.

The golden dataset I chose for evaluation consists of 1000 samples. Each sample includes 3 fields: query, related_documents, answer


**Recall@k**
|Model               | K=3    | K =5   | K=10    |
|-----------------   |--------|--------|---------|
|BGE-m3              | 55.11% | 63.43% | 72.18%  |
|E5                  | 54.61% | 63.53% | 72.02%  |
|Elasticsearch       | 42.54% | 49.61% | 56.85%  |
|Ensemble            | 68.38% | 74.85% | 80.66%  |
|Ensemble + rerank   | 79.82% | 82,82% | 87.66%  |

**Correctness**
